This is a 2D multiplayer shooter I wrote in Java when I was 16 years old.
It has monsters under ground which you can fight to collect crystals, which heal and increase the maximum health.
There are boss spawners as well, which get triggered when you walk over them.
Bosses drop 10 crystals.
For easier traversal around the terrain you can use your hook as well.

## Controls

* A - Walk left
* D - Walk right
* W - Jump
* Left mouse button - Shoot lasers
* Right mouse button - Throw grenade
* Q - Throw/release hook
